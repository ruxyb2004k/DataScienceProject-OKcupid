# DataScientist-OKcupid

### Project Goals

In this project, the goal is to utilize the skills learned through Codecademy and apply machine learning techniques to a data set. The following questions will be addressed in this study:
1. Can the open answers predict the sex of the user?
2. Can a user's astrological sign be predicted from other features of the user?
3. Bonus: is there a wage difference between the male and female users?

### Data

The project has one data set provided by Codecademy called `profiles.csv`. In the data, each row represents an OkCupid user and the columns are the responses to their user profiles which include multi-choice and short answer questions.

### Analysis

This solution will use descriptive statistics and data visualization to find key figures in understanding the distribution, count, and relationship between variables. 

### Evaluation

The project will conclude with the evaluation of the machine learning model selected with a validation data set. The output of the predictions can be checked through a confusion matrix, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores.
